    Machine learning, together with artificial intelligence, is used to help organizations keep up with the evolving

    Knowledge Consolidation :-

    Almost all online systems are vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, and preventing them demands the implementation of
    and adherence to several security protocols and standards. Machine learning security systems are capable of retaining
    information from decades-old data and utilizing consolidated knowledge to identify security breaches.
    A good example of consolidated learning is the IBM Watson platform. The security teams of IBM have repeatedly
    promoted Watson for state-of-the-art cybersecurity solutions. Its threat-sensing model holds training on unlimited 
    data points. Also, the cognitive learning power merges human and computer intelligence for detecting threats and
    minimizing security incidents.

    A Focus on Seamless Digital Experiences :-
    </strong> 
    </br>
    Leading organizations have a huge IT asset inventory, so it can get difficult to analyze all components for security 
    breach risks. AI-based systems can identify the components more susceptible to a breach and predict the expected attack 
    types so that companies can plan for tool and resource allocation toward weak areas.
There are cognitive learning-dependent models that track security points for authorized access. These models can identify 
remote hacks beforehand, notify users, and form extra security layers to prevent possible data breaches.
Valuable insights on hacks and breaches enable organizations to allocate applications and resources more effectively to 
make preparations for upcoming attacks and build significant cyber resilience.

    Malware & Phishing Detection :-
     </strong>

    Malware is a program transferred designed to harm a device, network, or server intentionally. Some common malware 
    activities include malicious advertising, data encryption, data deletion, accessing and controlling devices remotely,
    tracking user activity, and so on.

  },
  {
    para: `<strong>
    Ransomware Attacks:-
     </strong> 
    </br>
    Malware is seen as a ransomware attack if the attacker intends to take a ransom amount in return for the system or file
    access to the owner. While advanced applications efficiently detect common ransomware or malware attacks, it may get 
    challenging to filter out dynamically changing malicious agents.
    AI-driven cybersecurity systems are designed to detect malicious patterns more effectively. According to the director 
    of cybersecurity advocacy at Deep Instinct, Chuck Everette, the standard signature-based malware detection systems 
    prevent up to 60% of threats effectively, whereas AI-powered systems guarantee a security efficiency rate of over 90%.  
    Artificial intelligence researchers and security professionals employ many different techniques. One example is the 
    research carried out at Plymouth University, where malware detection was handled using computer vision. They used binary
     visualization analysis for converting files into colored picture representations displaying color distinction for 
     malicious files.The use of neural networks is another example to be covered. The researchers achieved a complete 
     malware detection accuracy of over 70% on every file format, with up to 94% accuracy for .pdf and .doc files.

    para: `<strong>
    Phishing Attacks:- 
    </strong> 
    </br>
    Attackers also deploy and activate malware through phishing attacks. Phishing is a fraudulent practice wherein 
    attackers trick people into revealing sensitive information through deceptive emails or websites.AI-driven systems
     can detect if a site or email is a phishing trap. These systems can also analyze malware based on its inherent
      characteristics; for example, if a solution is designed to encrypt or remove files without authorization,
       it is probably a threat. A phishing detection method proposed by researchers from the University of North Dakota 
       and based on machine learning analyzes the structure of emails and categorizes them as legitimate or illegitimate 
       emails successfully. Another instance of an AI-powered phishing detection solution is Mimecasts’s CyberGraph.
        This tool employs machine learning to prevent impersonation or phishing attacks. It has three main functionalities:
    <ul>
    <li style="list-style-type: circle ;"> Discerning patterns with the help of identity graphs to detect phishing emails
    </li>
    <li>Notifying users with colored warning banners that indicate the threat level
    </li>
    <li>Stopping trackers in emails capable of revealing sensitive information

    Detection of New Threats:- 
    </strong> 
    </br>
    The increasing complexity of software architectures also increases the possibility of new vulnerabilities and threats. 
    According to Statista, in 2022, internet users across the world discovered more than 25,000 new common security 
    vulnerabilities and exposures, the highest reported figure to date.Typical software solutions cannot keep pace with 
    lots of new malware created frequently, so this is where artificial intelligence can really help with. AI models
    incessantly update with data on recent vulnerabilities and threats, which helps with defense against new threat 
    actors and prevent any attacks.      With the use of advanced algorithms, AI detects cyber threats and malicious 
    activities. These systems spot malware, run pattern recognition, and highlight even the slightest patterns of 
    ransomware or malware attacks before it gets into the system. AI allows for predictive analysis that cybersecurity 
    experts can retrieve from a system. The system uses natural language processing which curates data by scraping 
    through research studies, articles, and news on cyber attacks, anomalies, and prevention strategies. In addition,
    these systems provide the latest knowledge of global and market-specific dangers to formulate major prioritization
    decisions. Keeping the success of AI in cybersecurity in focus, many tech giants, including IBM, Microsoft, and 
    Google, developed sophisticated AI systems for threat detection and control. Google’s Project Zero team identifies 
    and fixes web vulnerabilities to make the digital space safer. Additionally, Google Play Protect scans billions of
    applications on a regular basis for malware and other cyber threats.   What’s more, the Cyber Signals program 
    by Microsoft uses AI to analyze trillions of security signals and hacker groups to spot malicious activity and 
    application-related weaknesses. Microsoft reports that this program blocked more than 35.7 billion phishing 
    attacks and 25.6 billion identity theft tries on company accounts.

    Endpoint Protection:- </strong> 
    </br>
    More and more devices are getting used to working remotely, making endpoint protection highly important for any company
    seeking to protect its assets from a distance. Antivirus software and VPNs can be useful against remote ransomware and 
    malware attacks. A VPN is a service used to create a secure connection between a client and a network. Some of the 
    best VPNs,<a href="https://cybernews.com/best-vpn/nordvpn-vs-expressvpn/" target="_blank" style="color:#0E9CE8; "><b> like NordVPN and ExpressVPN </b></a>, are used to add security and anonymity to users while they connect to web-based
    services and sites.However, they also work based on signatures. This can be a concern because if a new type of
    malware attack occurs, signature protection may be unable to provide protection against it. AI-based endpoint
    protection handles it differently by establishing a behavior baseline for the endpoint via a repeated training
    process. AI flags anything that is abnormal and takes action, like notifying a technician or reverting to a safe 
    state after a ransomware attack.

     pose serious threats to businesses if they go undetected.AI should be used to help identify the bots' legitimacy and 
     discern the good bots, such as search engine crawlers, from bad ones. It enables cybersecurity teams to perform 
     analysis on large amounts of data and understand behavioral patterns when it comes to the manner a user generally 
     navigates a website.   Anomalous behavior can be detected at once, enabling experts to assess user journeys and

    Striking a balance between Automation and Human Skills:-

    The plus points of artificial intelligence are fully clear, but there are concerns about expertise being lost
   if maximum tasks are automated. Earlier, people gained expertise by spending hours performing complex tasks while working 
   their way up.Automating the processes has some incredible benefits, saving time that can be spent otherwise doing something
    of value. But how is it possible to automate AI cybersecurity operations without affecting the development of the existing 
    workforce?A balance between automation and human expertise is essential and key to productivity. Below are a few tips to help you maintain this vital balance:

export const Automation_vs_Human_Main_Four_Para = [ 
   {
    para: `<strong>Pick the Tasks to be Automated:- </strong> 
    </br>
    The primary step is to identify which tasks can be automated and which ones need human intervention. Any task that
    is time-consuming and unengaging and requires no creativity, high-order thinking, or decision-making is a good candidate 
    for automation. If a task needs to be performed at the same time or interval and includes the same sequence of steps, 
    then it could be automated.However, automation cannot fully replace human intervention. AI should not be left to function
     independently without human oversight since machines are basically machines, and they do not have any moral or social 
     compasses. Training should be given to AI across disparate data sets, and human checks have to be in place to maintain 
     the delicate balance.For example, AIs can now read, write, speak, and understand feelings. They also have the potential 
     to automate other types of tasks, such as scanning security videos for suspicious behavior, moderating content online, 
     responding to simple customer inquiries, inputting data, and maintaining records. However, planning or offering personalized 
     advice demands human expertise.

  },
  {
    para: `<strong>Upskill and Reskill Workforce:- </strong> 
    </br>
    In these times, the higher chances of routine tasks getting automated have led to concerns about job displacement and the
     increase of the skills gap. This situation demands companies to provide training and certification opportunities to create
      a future-ready workforce.Employees should learn new skills and receive thorough training in data analysis, programming, 
      machine learning, digital literacy, and cybersecurity to become capable of working alongside automated systems. They should 
      be offered support and advice through mentoring and workshops, in addition to these development opportunities ensuring that
       employees are confident in using the new technologies for handling cybersecurity issues.

  {
    para: `<strong>Increase Employee Involvement in the Implementation Process:- </strong> 
    </br>
    In today’s super-competitive business world, employee involvement plays a major role. It is said that an enterprise’s
     success or failure usually depends on its employees.So, companies should involve employees in the planning and
     implementation of AI systems for cybersecurity. In addition, they should solicit their feedback and ideas to improve the 
     overall process. Employees can partake in planning and continuous improvement by contributing their skills and ideas.
      In all, increasing the involvement of employees in the implementation process can boost productivity, limit resistance 
      to change, and build buy-in from the start.
    
`,
  },
  {
    para: `<strong>Focus on High-value Tasks:- </strong> 
    </br>
    With AI and automation, employees can get lots of time on hand that can be utilized to focus on more complex and high-level 
    tasks demanding human judgment and creativity. These tasks help companies move closer to accomplishing their business 
    objectives. Companies should understand the value of their time and where they decide to focus their efforts so that they 
    can make measurable progress toward getting the actual work done. They should restructure duties to ensure employees are
     spending all their time on tasks that add strategic value and benefit employee development and growth.
    
`,
  },
  {
    para: `<strong>Prioritize Customer Experience:- </strong> 
    </br>
    Automation can make processes more efficient and faster and save the company time and money, but it should not 
    come at the cost of customer experience. When using automated phone systems and chatbots, customers prefer human
     support as they don't like speaking to robots at all times. A recent survey found that nearly 70% of consumers said 
     they would rather communicate with a human customer service representative than a digital service representative or chatbot.
      So, automation should not cause consumer frustration when they seek human connection. Customers will trust people more than
       technology. The more company show them empathy and find ways of connecting with them, the more benefit they have. 
       Therefore, it is important to ensure that automation is designed to improve customer experience and not hinder it.
    
`,

  {
    para: `<strong>Track and Evaluate:- </strong> 
    </br>
    Focus on keeping track of automated processes to ensure they work effectively and analyze the customer response to improve 
    where needed. Evaluate the balance between automation and human skills and make adjustments as required.

  },
  {
    para: `<strong>Final Thoughts:- </strong> 
    </br>
    The benefits of artificial intelligence in cybersecurity exceed the areas mentioned earlier, and in 2023 and beyond,
     artificial intelligence will become a crucial and essential element in cybersecurity systems across the world.
    The better approach is to adopt robust automation systems for AI cybersecurity as they can transform a business and how 
    the employees work. But we must stay mindful of its influence on employee development, as the human element will always 
    remain the most valuable asset.
    Therefore, the key takeaway here is that employers must pick the tasks that are better suited for machines so that
     they can be automated, leaving human beings to perform more creative and rewarding tasks. Plus, companies must equip their employees with the skills important for success in the 21st century.
